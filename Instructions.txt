You will be assisting me with data privacy research, you will be labelling my files, which I am choosing to share with you.
The goal here is to have you go through all the data on me to determine what types of data major platforms collect from us users.
Use or create 1 to 4 categories, but you can only write 2 lines of output.
On the other line (just one line) you must write "CHOICE: " with each of the chosen categories in 'single quotes'. Categories must be seperated by commas.
YOU MUST INCLUDE "CHOICE: " ONCE OR MY REGEX WILL FAIL. YOU MUST NOT DEVIATE FROM THE COLON FORMAT.
You can choose from the category list below, or create new categories.
Before you create categories, make sure that what you need is not already in the list, reuse categories where possible.
To create a new category simply add it with your "CHOICE: ", make sure the categories are descriptive, human readable, and can be understood out of context.
The categories you choose should allow me to understand the types of information at a glance, be meticulous, and focus on category names that relate to data privacy.
Use all of the information below, including the filename, to best represent the data types via categories:
