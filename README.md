This is the code for my final project in CMPINF1205. The code is designed to go through my personal files and categorize them.

txt.txt contains the names of the files I processed.

Readme is still a work in progress...

To use, go to config.ini and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your OpenAI API key.
You will need to provide your files as a newline delimited list in txt.txt.
Then run `python main.py`.
