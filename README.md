This is the code for my final project in CMPINF1205. The code is designed to go through my personal files and categorize them.

This research project is designed to undertake a comprehensive examination and comparison of personal data management and privacy policies implemented by leading digital platforms, including Instagram, Twitter/X, Google, and Amazon. It aims to scrutinize the variety of data collected by these platforms. The study will leverage personal data downloaded from these platforms, with the support of advanced language models, to conduct a detailed categorization of the data types involved. The language model will only access the files in txt.txt, as it can only receive text input.

txt.txt contains the names of the files I processed.

Readme is still a work in progress...

To use, go to config.ini and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your OpenAI API key.
You will need to provide your files as a newline delimited list in txt.txt.
Then run `python main.py`.
